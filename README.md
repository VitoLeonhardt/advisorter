Adviqo coding challenge.

Notes:
 - for styling, used Semantic UI CSS framework (https://react.semantic-ui.com/) and some custom css
 - used hooks as per modern react development practices
 - added some very basic tests in react-testing-library
 - added timeout to simulate network traffic; instead of promises, used modern await-async, which is used in the tests to wait for the data to load
 - as a bonus, it's possible to sort by all the fields, not just review number. Click on the table header to sort.
